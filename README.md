# MYNET Assessment
Basic CRUD work completed in 2 days

This was actually for a job interview assessment, of which I declined due to the company offering salary way below market rate
## TODO

- Validation (client & server side)
- More object-oriented approach
- Clean code
- RESTify the system
- Follow [PHP Standards Recommendations (PSRs)](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/), specifically:
	- [PSR-1](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-1/)
	- [PSR-2](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/)
